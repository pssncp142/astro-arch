## astro-arch 

An Arch linux repo containing a compilation of astronomy software. 

I am still investigating ins and outs of OBS service so it is not ready. Suggestions are welcome.

To add the repo, add the following to your /etc/pacman.conf:

```
[home_ydallilar_astro-arch_Arch]
SigLevel = PackageOptional
Server = https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/ydallilar:/astro-arch/Arch/$arch
```

Use the key id: F470A12C5FCEFC5576745378D09971F8C98D1D5A
